/// Helps overcome limitations of the lifetime system when constructing MIDI events and files.
///
/// Because many events contain references to data that outlives them, it can be hard to build a
/// MIDI file programatically.
///
/// Consider the following code:
///
/// ```rust,compile_fail
/// use midly::{TrackEvent, TrackEventKind, MetaMessage};
///
/// let mut track = Vec::new();
/// for i in 0..64 {
///     let marker_name = format!("Marker {}", i);
///     let marker_ref = marker_name.as_bytes();
///     track.push(TrackEvent {
///         delta: 0.into(),
///         kind: TrackEventKind::Meta(MetaMessage::Marker(marker_ref)),
///     });
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Looks pretty good, but it fails to compile with
/// `error[E0597]: "marker_name" does not live long enough`, with a rightful reason: `marker_name`
/// is dropped before the next iteration of the `for` loop.
///
/// Instead, use the [`Arena`](struct.Arena.html) type like the following code:
///
/// ```rust
/// use midly::{TrackEvent, TrackEventKind, MetaMessage};
///
/// let arena = midly::Arena::new();
/// let mut track = Vec::new();
/// for i in 0..64 {
///     let marker_name = format!("Marker {}", i);
///     let marker_ref = arena.add(marker_name.as_bytes());
///     track.push(TrackEvent {
///         delta: 0.into(),
///         kind: TrackEventKind::Meta(MetaMessage::Marker(marker_ref)),
///     });
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This type is only available with the `alloc` feature enabled.
